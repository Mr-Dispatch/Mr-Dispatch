Hi there, MrDispatch here,

programming language Connoisseur & tech enthusiast, "maker" (as in "dicks around with a 3d printer & embedded stuff").
I work as an "admin" in a large company (I also do some internal automation / code our own management,monitoring or digital signature tools), where I mostly work with Windows and boring/corporate programming languages.

To not go insane, I use Linux & whatever interesting programming languages I can get my hands on in my free time. I especially love (in no particular order):

- Smalltalk
- Haskell
- Prolog
- Rust
- Forth & Factor
- Go (give me generics or give me death ;-)

I also think that "HTML/CSS/JS + browser as the fattest, dumbest runtime" is the WORST FAD EVER. I don't care if it seems to work when it's all made out of dried dung. So don't you come at me with "cool, but it would be better as a web app" suggestions ;-)
